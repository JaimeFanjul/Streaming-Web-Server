# Streaming-Web-Server

This project contains the structure of a web server which streams data on web page allocated in self. Backend - frontend, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Nodejs, Plotly, SocketIO.

The key point in this project is how to handle the events and build the proper data structures mainly json. When a user request the web page automatically the main html calls a js script
which opens a data stream between the browser and the server this way it is possible to send data and stream it to the web page. Combining a stream of data with plotly lib, 
it is able to graph data in real time. The web page has been structured with css grid to add proper dynamism. 

To deploy the server node modules (Node.js) are required.
